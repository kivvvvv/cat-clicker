# Cat Clicker

Initially, this mini project was **only** used as my learning playground in order to learn the Javascript design pattern. I learned to build an **organized application** without an organizational Javascript library or framework. For more detail of this course, please go [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).

## Foreward

For some time, I was looking for a small project that not only serve as a representation of _some skill_ that I already possessed, but rather, more importantly, __how I learned what I learned__.

I normally, take some note when learning. But truthfully, all of them is not well-formatted. Only I myself can read what I write but I can't share it and the whole circle just stop there. 

However, this is going to be the first time that I share some of my __reflections__ of what I have learned, to practice writting document and maybe gain some confident in the same time. And hopefully, some time later, I will confidently be able to __share my knowledge__ in some form or media that will be useful for anyone.

And that is when this project came into my mind. Since then, so I started re-documenting it.
Feel free to proceed to the first section in this repo wiki [here](https://github.com/kivvvvv/cat-clicker/wiki).

However, this may or may not be served as a soft introduction to myself. So, if you interested in more advanced project, which might represent more of _myself_, I have a few:

- [Matching Game](https://github.com/kivvvvv/matching-game) - A board matching game, written in React.
- [Note App](https://github.com/kivvvvv/note-app) - A responsive note app, powered by React

This project may contain some opinionated code and thoughts, and not strictly follow the course progression due to the curriculum is not designed for expressing the learner's thoughts but rather for the best learning experience.
