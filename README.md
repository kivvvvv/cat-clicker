# Cat Clicker
Initially, this mini project was used as a learning playground resource in order to learn the Javascript design pattern. I was taught to build an __organized application__ without an organizational Javascript library or framework.

## Foreward
For some time, I was looking for a small project which will serve as a soft introduction to represent what skills I already possessed for potentially my future employer. That is when this project came into my mind.

If you interested in more advanced project, which might represent more of *myself*, I have a few:
* [Matching Game](https://github.com/kivvvvv/matching-game) - A board matching game, written in React.
* [Note App](https://github.com/kivvvvv/note-app) - A responsive note app, powered by React
